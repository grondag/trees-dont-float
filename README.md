When this mod is installed and the last log supporting a tree is broken, the whole tree comes down.  Designed to be server-friendly.


Cautions:
* This mod will break anything made of logs if the last supporting log is broken!  Be careful with your structures. 
* If the mod is configured to combine item stacks and the server saves the world and exits before breaking is complete, you may not get all of your drops from a tree that is in the process of breaking.  You can turn this feature off so that items always drop immediately, but that will generate more lag.  Fortunately, wood is cheap.
